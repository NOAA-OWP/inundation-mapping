## v3.0.22.5 - 2021-09-08 - [PR #460](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/460)

Patches an issue where only certain benchmark categories were being used in evaluation.

## Changes
- In `tools/tools_shared_variables.py`, created a variable `MAGNITUDE_DICT` to store benchmark category magnitudes.
- `synthesize_test_cases.py` imports `MAGNITUDE_DICT` and uses it to assign magnitudes.

<br/><br/>

## v3.0.22.4 - 2021-08-30 - [PR #456](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/456)

Renames the BARC modified variables that are exported to `src_full_crosswalked.csv` to replace the original variables. The default/original variables are renamed with `orig_` prefix. This change is needed to ensure downstream uses of the `src_full_crosswalked.csv` are able to reference the authoritative version of the channel geometry variables (i.e. BARC-adjust where available).

## Changes
- In `src_full_crosswalked.csv`, default/original variables are renamed with `orig_` prefix and `SA_div` is renamed to `SA_div_flag`.

<br/><br/>

## v3.0.22.3 - 2021-08-27 - [PR #457](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/457)

This fixes a bug in the `get_metadata()` function in `/tools/tools_shared_functions.py` that arose because of a WRDS update. Previously the `metadata_source` response was returned as independent variables, but now it is returned a list of strings. Another issue was observed where the `EVALUATED_SITES_CSV` variable was being misdefined (at least on the development VM) through the OS environmental variable setting.

## Changes
- In `tools_shared_functions.py`, changed parsing of WRDS `metadata_sources` to account for new list type.
- In `generate_categorical_fim_flows.py`, changed the way the `EVALUATED_SITES_CSV` path is defined from OS environmental setting to a relative path that will work within Docker container.

<br/><br/>

## v3.0.22.2 - 2021-08-26 - [PR #455](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/455)

This merge addresses an issues with the bathymetry adjusted rating curve (BARC) calculations exacerbating single-pixel inundation issues for the lower Mississippi River. This fix allows the user to specify a stream order value that will be ignored in BARC calculations (reverts to using the original/default rating curve). If/when the "thalweg notch" issue is addressed, this change may be unmade.

## Changes
- Added new env variable `ignore_streamorders` set to 10.
- Added new BARC code to set the bathymetry adjusted cross-section area to 0 (reverts to using the default SRC values) based on the streamorder env variable.

<br/><br/>

## v3.0.22.1 - 2021-08-20 - [PR #447](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/447)

Patches the minimum stream length in the template parameters file.

## Changes

<br/><br/>

## v3.0.22.0 - 2021-08-19 - [PR #444](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/444)

This adds a script, `adjust_rc_with_feedback.py`, that will be expanded  in future issues. The primary function that performs the HAND value and hydroid extraction is ingest_points_layer() but this may change as the overall synthetic rating curve automatic update machanism evolves.

## Additions
- Added `adjust_rc_with_feedback.py` with `ingest_points_layer()`, a function to extract HAND and hydroid values for use in an automatic synthetic rating curve updating mechanism.

<br/><br/>

## v3.0.21.0 - 2021-08-18 - [PR #433](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/433)

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.18.0 - 2021-06-09 - [PR #404](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/404)

To help analyze the memory consumption of the Fim Run process, the python module `memory-profiler` has been added to give insights into where peak memory usage is with in the codebase.

In addition, the Dockerfile was previously broken due to the Taudem dependency removing the version that was previously being used by FIM. To fix this, and allow new docker images to be built, the Taudem version has been updated to the newest version on the Github repo and thus needs to be thoroughly tested to determine if this new version has affected the overall FIM outputs.

## Additions
- Added `memory-profiler` to `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.
- Added `mprof` (memory-profiler cli utility) call to the `time_and_tee_run_by_unit.sh` to create overall memory usage graph location in the `/logs/{HUC}_memory.png` of the outputs directory.
- Added `@profile` decorator to all functions within scripts used in the `run_by_unit.sh` script to allow for memory usage tracking, which is then recorded in the `/logs/{HUC}.log` file of the outputs directory.

## Changes
- Changed the Taudem version in `Dockerfile.dev` to `98137bb6541a0d0077a9c95becfed4e56d0aa0ac`.
- Changed all calls of python scripts in `run_by_unit.s` to be called with the `-m memory-profiler` argument to allow scripts to also track memory usage.

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.17.1 - 2021-06-04 - [PR #395](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/395)

Bug fix to the `generate_nws_lid.py` script

## Changes
- Fixes incorrectly assigned attribute field "is_headwater" for some sites in the `nws_lid.gpkg` layer.
- Updated `agg_nhd_headwaters_adj.gpkg`, `agg_nhd_streams_adj.gpkg`, `nwm_flows.gpkg`, and `nwm_catchments.gpkg` input layers using latest NWS LIDs.

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.17.0 - 2021-06-04 - [PR #393](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/393)

## Changes

- Added new env variable to control which input file is used for the bankfull geometry input to bathy estimation workflow.
- Modified the bathymetry cross section area calculation to cap the additional area value so that it cannot exceed the bankfull cross section area value for each stream segment (bankfull value obtained from regression equation dataset).
- Modified the `rating_curve_comparison.py` plot output to always put the FIM rating curve on top of the USGS rating curve (avoids USGS points covering FIM).
- Created a new aggregate csv file (aggregates for all hucs) for all of the `usgs_elev_table.csv` files (one per huc).
- Evaluate the FIM Bathymetry Adjusted Rating Curve (BARC) tool performance using the estimated bankfull geometry dataset derived for the NWM route link dataset.

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.15.1 - 2021-04-13 - [PR #355](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/355)

Sierra test considered all USGS gage locations to be mainstems even though many actually occurred with tributaries. This resulted in unrealistic comparisons as incorrect gages were assigned to mainstems segments. This feature branch identifies gages that are on mainstems via attribute field.

## Changes

- Modifies `usgs_gage_crosswalk.py` to filter out gages from the `usgs_gages.gpkg` layer such that for a "MS" run, only consider gages that contain rating curve information (via `curve` attribute) and are also mainstems gages (via `mainstems` attribute).
- Modifies `usgs_gage_crosswalk.py` to filter out gages from the `usgs_gages.gpkg` layer such that for a "FR" run, only consider gages that contain rating curve information (via `curve` attribute) and are not mainstems gages (via `mainstems` attribute).
- Modifies how mainstems segments are determined by using the `nwm_flows_ms.gpkg` as a lookup to determine if the NWM segment specified by WRDS for a gage site is a mainstems gage.

## Additions

- Adds a `mainstem` attribute field to `usgs_gages.gpkg` that indicates whether a gage is located on a mainstems river.
- Adds `NWM_FLOWS_MS` variable to the `.env` and `.env.template` files.
- Adds the `extent` argument specified by user when running `fim_run.sh` to `usgs_gage_crosswalk.py`.

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.15.0 - 2021-04-08 - [PR #340](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/340)

Implementing a prototype technique to estimate the missing bathymetric component in the HAND-derived synthetic rating curves. The new Bathymetric Adjusted Rating Curve (BARC) function is built within the `fim_run.sh` workflow and will ingest bankfull geometry estimates provided by the user to modify the cross section area used in the synthetic rating curve generation.

### Changes
 - `add_crosswalk.py` outputs the stream order variables to `src_full_crosswalked.csv` and calls the new `bathy_rc_adjust.py` if bathy env variable set to True and `extent=MS`.
 - `run_by_unit.sh` includes a new csv outputs for reviewing BARC calculations.
 - `params_template.env` & `params_calibrated.env` contain new BARC function input variables and on/off toggle variable.
 - `eval_plots.py` now includes additional AHPS eval sites in the list of "bad_sites" (flagged issues with MS flowlines).

### Additions
 - `bathy_rc_adjust.py`:
    - Imports the existing synthetic rating curve table and the bankfull geometry input data (topwidth and cross section area per COMID).
    - Performs new synthetic rating curve calculations with bathymetry estimation modifications.
    - Flags issues with the thalweg-notch artifact.

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.14.0 - 2021-04-05 - [PR #338](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/338)

Create tool to retrieve rating curves from USGS sites and convert to elevation (NAVD88). Intended to be used as part of the Sierra Test.

### Changes
 - Modify `usgs_gage_crosswalk.py` to:
    1) Look for `location_id` instead of `site_no` attribute field in `usgs_gages.gpkg` file.
    2) Filter out gages that do not have rating curves included in the `usgs_rating_curves.csv`.
 - Modify `rating_curve_comparison.py` to perform a check on the age of the user specified `usgs_rating_curves.csv` and alert user to the age of the file and recommend updating if file is older the 30 days.

### Additions
 - Add `rating_curve_get_usgs_curves.py`. This script will generate the following files:
     1) `usgs_rating_curves.csv`: A csv file that contains rating curves (including converted to NAVD88 elevation) for USGS gages in a format that is compatible with  `rating_curve_comparisons.py`. As it is is currently configured, only gages within CONUS will have rating curve data.
     2) `log.csv`: A log file that records status for each gage and includes error messages.
     3) `usgs_gages.gpkg`: A geospatial layer (in FIM projection) of all active USGS gages that meet a predefined criteria. Additionally, the `curve` attribute indicates whether a rating curve is found in the `usgs_rating_curves.csv`. This spatial file is only generated if the `all` option is passed with the `-l` argument.

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.13.0 - 2021-04-01 - [PR #332](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/332)

Created tool to compare synthetic rating curve with benchmark rating curve (Sierra Test).

### Changes
 - Update `aggregate_fim_outputs.py` call argument in `fim_run.sh` from 4 jobs to 6 jobs, to optimize API performance.
 - Reroutes median elevation data from `add_crosswalk.py` and `rem.py` to new file (depreciating `hand_ref_elev_table.csv`).
 - Adds new files to `viz_whitelist` in `output_cleanup.py`.

### Additions
 - `usgs_gage_crosswalk.py`: generates `usgs_elev_table.csv` in `run_by_unit.py` with elevation and additional attributes at USGS gages.
 - `rating_curve_comparison.py`: post-processing script to plot and calculate metrics between synthetic rating curves and USGS rating curve data.

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.12.1 - 2021-03-31 - [PR #336](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/336)

Fix spatial option in `eval_plots.py` when creating plots and spatial outputs.

### Changes
 - Removes file dependencies from spatial option. Does require the WBD layer which should be specified in `.env` file.
 - Produces outputs in a format consistent with requirements needed for publishing.
 - Preserves leading zeros in huc information for all outputs from `eval_plots.py`.

### Additions
 - Creates `fim_performance_points.shp`: this layer consists of all evaluated ahps points (with metrics). Spatial data retrieved from WRDS on the fly.
 - Creates `fim_performance_polys.shp`: this layer consists of all evaluated huc8s (with metrics). Spatial data retrieved from WBD layer.

 - The code block in `run_test_case.py` that was responsible for printing the colored metrics to screen has been commented out because of the new scale of evaluations (formerly in `run_test_case.py`, now in `shared_functions.py`)
 - Remove unused imports from inundation wrappers in `/tools`.

### Changes

 - Updated `synthesize_test_cases.py` to allow for AHPS site evaluations.

 - Produces new output containing all catchment ids and min thalweg elevation value named `hand_ref_elev_table.csv`.
 - Overwrites the `demDerived_reaches_split.gpk` layer by adding additional attribute `Min_Thal_Elev_meters` to view the elevation value for each hydroid.

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.4.2 - 2021-02-12 - [PR #255](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/255)

Addresses issue when running on HUC6 scale.

### Changes

 - `src.json` should be fixed and slightly smaller by removing whitespace.
 - Rasters are about the same size as running fim as huc6 (compressed and tiled; aggregated are slightly larger).
 - Naming convention and feature id attribute are only added to the aggregated hucs.
 - HydroIDs are different for huc6 vs aggregated huc8s mostly due to forced split at huc boundaries (so long we use consistent workflow it shouldn't matter).
 - Fixed known issue where sometimes an incoming stream is not included in the final selection will affect aggregate outputs.

<br/><br/>
