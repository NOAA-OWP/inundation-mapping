## Cahaba: Flood Inundation Mapping for U.S. National Water Model

Flood inundation mapping software configured to work with the U.S. National Water Model operated and maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Water Center (NWC).

This software uses the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) method to generate Relative Elevation Models (REMs), Synthetic Rating Curves (SRCs), and catchment grids. This repository also includes functionality to generate flood inundation maps (FIMs) and evaluate FIM accuracy.

## Dependencies

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Installation

1. Install Docker : [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Build Docker Image : `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t <image_name>:<tag> <path/to/repository>`
3. Create FIM group on host machine:
    - Linux: `groupadd -g 1370800178 fim`
4. Change group ownership of repo (needs to be redone when a new file occurs in the repo):
    - Linux: `chgrp -R fim <path/to/repository>`

## Configuration

This software is configurable via parameters found in the `config` directory. Copy files before editing and remove "template" pattern from the filename.
Make sure to set the config folder group to 'fim' recursively using the chown command. Each development version will include a calibrated parameter set of manning’s n values.
- `params_template.env`
- `mannings_default.json`
    - must change filepath in `params_template.env` under "manning_n" variable name
- `params_calibrated.env`
    - runs calibrated mannings parameters from `mannings_calibrated.json`

## Input Data

The following input data sources should be downloaded and preprocessed prior to executing the preprocessing & hydrofabric generation code:
### USACE National Levee Database:
- Access here: https://levees.sec.usace.army.mil/
- Download the “Full GeoJSON” file for the area of interest
- Unzip data and then use the preprocessing scripts to filter data and fix geometries where needed

### NHDPlus HR datasets
- `acquire_and_preprocess_inputs.py`
- `aggregate_nhd_hr_streams.py`

**Please note:** For the following two datasets, please contact Brad Bates (bradford.bates@noaa.gov). We are currently working on a long-term data sharing solution for the in-house NOAA data.

### NWM Hydrofabric
- `nwm_flows.gpkg`
- `nwm_catchments.gpkg`
- `nwm_lakes.gpkg`
- `nwm_headwaters.gpkg`

### AHPS Site Locations (For Mainstem Configuration)
- `nws_lid.gpkg`
- `ms_segs.gpkg`

----
## Usage

### Run Docker Container
```
docker run --rm -it -v <path/to/data>:/data -v <path/to/repository>:/foss_fim <image_name>:<tag>
```

### Acquire and Prepare Data
```
/foss_fim/src/acquire_and_preprocess_inputs.py -u <huc4s_to_process>
```
- `-u` can be a single HUC4, series of HUC4s (e.g. 1209 1210), path to line-delimited file with HUC4s.
- Please run `/foss_fim/src/acquire_and_preprocess_inputs.py --help` for more information.
- See United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Hydrography Dataset Plus High Resolution (NHDPlusHR) [site](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution) for more information

### Aggregate NHDHR Streams and Create NWM Headwater Points 
```
/foss_fim/src/aggregate_vector_inputs.py
```
### Produce Hydrofabric 
```
fim_run.sh -u <huc4,6,or8s> -c /foss_fim/config/<your_params_file.env> -n <name_your_run>
```
- `-u` can be a single huc, a series passed in quotes, or a line-delimited file
    i. To run entire domain of available data use one of the ```/data/inputs/included_huc[4,6,8].lst``` files
- Outputs can be found under ```/data/outputs/<name_your_run>```

----
## Evaluating Inundation Map Performance
After `fim_run.sh` completes, you are ready to evaluate the model's skill.

**Please note:** You will need access to the test_cases benchmark data. You can acquire the benchmark data from Brad Bates (bradford.bates@noaa.gov). As mentioned before, a long term data sharing solution is still in the works.

To evaluate model skill, run the following:
```
python /foss_fim/tests/synthesize_test_cases.py -c DEV -v <fim_run_name> -m <path/to/output/metrics.csv> -j [num_of_jobs]
```

More information can be found by running:
```
python /foss_fim/tests/synthesize_test_cases.py --help
```

----
## Dependencies

Dependencies are managed via [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). To add new dependencies, from the projects's top-level directory:

```bash
pipenv install ipython --dev
```

The `--dev` flag adds development dependencies, omit it if you want to add a production dependency. If the environment looks goods after adding dependencies, lock it with:

```bash
pipenv lock
```

and include both `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` in your commits. The docker image installs the environment from the lock file.

If you are on a machine that has a particularly slow internet connection, you may need to increase the timeout of pipenv. To do this simply add `PIPENV_INSTALL_TIMEOUT=10000000` in front of any of your pipenv commands.
