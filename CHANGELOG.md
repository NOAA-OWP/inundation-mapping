## v3.0.0.0 - 2020-12-22

The software released here builds on the flood inundation mapping capabilities demonstrated as part of the National Flood Interoperability Experiment, the Office of Water Prediction's Innovators Program and the National Water Center Summer Institute. The flood inundation mapping software implements the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) algorithm and incorporates community feedback and lessons learned over several years. The software has been designed to meet the requirements set by stakeholders interested in flood prediction and has been developed in partnership with several entities across the water enterprise.
