Enhancements to allow for evaluation at AHPS sites, the generation of a query-optimized metrics CSV, and the generation of categorical FIM. This merge requires that the `/test_cases` directory be updated for all machines performing evaluation.

 - The code block in `run_test_case.py` that was responsible for printing the colored metrics to screen has been commented out because of the new scale of evaluations (formerly in `run_test_case.py`, now in `shared_functions.py`)
 - Remove unused imports from inundation wrappers in `/tools`.

### Changes

 - Updated `synthesize_test_cases.py` to allow for AHPS site evaluations.
 - Reorganized `run_test_case.py` by moving more functions into `shared_functions.py`.
 - Created more shared variables in `shared_variables.py` and updated import statements in relevant scripts.

## v3.0.4.4 - 2021-02-19 - [PR #266](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/266)

Rating curves for short stream segments are replaced with rating curves from upstream/downstream segments.

 - `fossid` renamed to `fimid` and the attribute's starting value is now 1000 to avoid HydroIDs with leading zeroes.
 - Addresses issue where HydroIDs were not included in final hydrotable.
 - Added `import sys` to `inundation.py` (missing from previous feature branch).
 - Variable names and general workflow are cleaned up.

 - Merge hydroid df and thalweg minimum elevation df.
 - Produces new output containing all catchment ids and min thalweg elevation value named `hand_ref_elev_table.csv`.
 - Overwrites the `demDerived_reaches_split.gpk` layer by adding additional attribute `Min_Thal_Elev_meters` to view the elevation value for each hydroid.

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.4.2 - 2021-02-12 - [PR #255](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/255)

Addresses issue when running on HUC6 scale.

### Changes

 - `src.json` should be fixed and slightly smaller by removing whitespace.
 - Rasters are about the same size as running fim as huc6 (compressed and tiled; aggregated are slightly larger).
 - Naming convention and feature id attribute are only added to the aggregated hucs.
 - HydroIDs are different for huc6 vs aggregated huc8s mostly due to forced split at huc boundaries (so long we use consistent workflow it shouldn't matter).
 - Fixed known issue where sometimes an incoming stream is not included in the final selection will affect aggregate outputs.

<br/><br/>
## v3.0.4.1 - 2021-02-12 - [PR #261](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/261)

Updated MS Crosswalk method to address gaps in FIM.

## v3.0.0.0 - 2020-12-22 - [PR #181](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/181)

The software released here builds on the flood inundation mapping capabilities demonstrated as part of the National Flood Interoperability Experiment, the Office of Water Prediction's Innovators Program and the National Water Center Summer Institute. The flood inundation mapping software implements the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) algorithm and incorporates community feedback and lessons learned over several years. The software has been designed to meet the requirements set by stakeholders interested in flood prediction and has been developed in partnership with several entities across the water enterprise.
