## v3.0.0.3 - 2021-01-14 - [PR #210](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/210)

Hotfix for handling nodata value in rasterized levee lines.

### Changes

 - Resolves bug for HUCs where `$ndv > 0` (Great Lakes region).
 - Initialize the `nld_rasterized_elev.tif` using a value of `-9999` instead of `$ndv`.
 
## v3.0.0.2 - 2021-01-06 - [PR #200](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/200)

Patch to address AHPSs mapping errors.

### Changes

 - Checks `dtype` of `hydroTable.csv` columns to resolve errors caused in `inundation.py` when joining to flow forecast.
 - Exits `inundation.py` when all hydrotable HydroIDs are lake features.
 - Updates path to latest AHPs site layer.
 - Updated [readme](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/commit/9bffb885f32dfcd95978c7ccd2639f9df56ff829)

## v3.0.0.1 - 2020-12-31 - [PR #184](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/184)

Modifications to build and run Docker image more reliably. Cleanup on some pre-processing scripts.

### Changes

 - Changed to noninteractive install of GRASS.
 - Changed some paths from relative to absolute and cleaned up some python shebang lines.

### Notes

## v3.0.0.0 - 2020-12-22 - [PR #181](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/181)

The software released here builds on the flood inundation mapping capabilities demonstrated as part of the National Flood Interoperability Experiment, the Office of Water Prediction's Innovators Program and the National Water Center Summer Institute. The flood inundation mapping software implements the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) algorithm and incorporates community feedback and lessons learned over several years. The software has been designed to meet the requirements set by stakeholders interested in flood prediction and has been developed in partnership with several entities across the water enterprise.
