## v3.0.3.1 - 2021-02-04 - [PR #253](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/253)

Bug fixes to correct mismatched variable name and file path.

### Changes

 - Corrected variable name in `fim_run.sh`.
 - `acquire_and_preprocess_inputs.py` now creates `huc_lists` folder and updates file path.

## v3.0.3.0 - 2021-02-04 - [PR #227](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/227)

Post-process to aggregate FIM outputs to HUC6 scale.

### Additions

 - Viz outputs aggregated to HUC6 scale; saves outputs to `aggregate_fim_outputs` folder.
 
### Changes

 - `split_flows.py` now splits streams at HUC8 boundaries to ensure consistent catchment boundaries along edges.
 - `aggregate_fim_outputs.sh` has been depreciated but remains in the repo for potential FIM 4 development.
 - Replaced geopandas driver arg with getDriver throughout repo.
 - Organized parameters in environment files by group.
 - Cleaned up variable names in `split_flows.py` and `build_stream_traversal.py`.
 - `build_stream_traversal.py` is now assigning HydroID by midpoint instead centroid.
 - Cleanup of `clip_vectors_to_wbd.py`.

## v3.0.2.0 - 2021-01-25 - [PR #218](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/218)

Addition of an API service to schedule, run and manage `fim_run` jobs through a user-friendly web interface.

### Additions

 - `api` folder that contains all the codebase for the new service.

## v3.0.1.0 - 2021-01-21 - [PR #206](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/206)

Preprocess MS and FR stream networks

### Changes

 - Headwater stream segments geometries are adjusted to align with with NWM streams.
 - Incoming streams are selected using intersection points between NWM streams and HUC4 boundaries.
 - `clip_vectors_to_wbd.py` handles local headwaters.
 - Removes NHDPlus features categorized as coastline and underground conduit.  
 - Added streams layer to production whitelist.
 - Fixed progress bar in `lib/acquire_and_preprocess_inputs.py`.
 - Added `getDriver` to shared `functions.py`.
 - Cleaned up variable names and types.

## v3.0.0.4 - 2021-01-20 - [PR #230](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/230)

Changed the directory where the `included_huc*.lst` files are being read from.

## v3.0.0.3 - 2021-01-14 - [PR #210](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/210)

Hotfix for handling nodata value in rasterized levee lines.

### Changes

 - Resolves bug for HUCs where `$ndv > 0` (Great Lakes region).
 - Initialize the `nld_rasterized_elev.tif` using a value of `-9999` instead of `$ndv`.
 
## v3.0.0.2 - 2021-01-06 - [PR #200](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/200)

Patch to address AHPSs mapping errors.

### Changes

 - Checks `dtype` of `hydroTable.csv` columns to resolve errors caused in `inundation.py` when joining to flow forecast.
 - Exits `inundation.py` when all hydrotable HydroIDs are lake features.
 - Updates path to latest AHPs site layer.
 - Updated [readme](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/commit/9bffb885f32dfcd95978c7ccd2639f9df56ff829)

## v3.0.0.1 - 2020-12-31 - [PR #184](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/184)

Modifications to build and run Docker image more reliably. Cleanup on some pre-processing scripts.

### Changes

 - Changed to noninteractive install of GRASS.
 - Changed some paths from relative to absolute and cleaned up some python shebang lines.

### Notes
 - `aggregate_vector_inputs.py` doesn't work yet. Need to externally download required data to run fim_run.sh
 
## v3.0.0.0 - 2020-12-22 - [PR #181](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cahaba/pull/181)

The software released here builds on the flood inundation mapping capabilities demonstrated as part of the National Flood Interoperability Experiment, the Office of Water Prediction's Innovators Program and the National Water Center Summer Institute. The flood inundation mapping software implements the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) algorithm and incorporates community feedback and lessons learned over several years. The software has been designed to meet the requirements set by stakeholders interested in flood prediction and has been developed in partnership with several entities across the water enterprise.
